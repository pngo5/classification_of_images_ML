# 🧠 Image Classification using Machine Learning & CNN

This project showcases how to classify images using Python-based machine learning, particularly leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Through a guided Jupyter Notebook, it demonstrates image preprocessing, model creation, and predictions using real-world images.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Image classification is a core task in computer vision. This project serves as a hands-on tutorial, allowing users to understand:

- How to prepare image data
- The basics of building CNNs using Keras
- Classifying unseen images like animals, vehicles, and more

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Keras** and **TensorFlow** (backend for deep learning)
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **PIL** for data processing and visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for step-by-step execution

## 📦 Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed. You’ll also need Jupyter Notebook.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pngo5/classification_of_images_ML.git
   cd classification_of_images_ML
   ```

2. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements
   ```

3. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Classify Images Using Python & Machine Learning.ipynb"
   ```

---

## 🧪 Usage

- Run each cell in the notebook to follow the complete workflow.
- Images like `cat.jpg`, `hawk.jpg`, and `TeslaRoadster_gen2.jpg` are used to predict their content using the trained CNN.
- You can replace these images with your own to test custom predictions.

---

## 🧰 Features

- CNN model trained to differentiate various image types
- Step-by-step explanation of layers and predictions
- Fully visual with plots and output image predictions

---

## 🐳 Docker (Optional)

The Dockerfile is present but not fully configured. If you’d like to run this in a container, additional setup is needed.
